# Seam-Carving
Uses content-aware image resizing to select the "least interesting" seam of an image and remove it, effectively compressing the image to its most important details. The user can also visualize seeing the energy of each pixel in grayscale (a measure of contrast relative to nearby pixels), or seeing the cumulative weight of each seam in grayscale.
